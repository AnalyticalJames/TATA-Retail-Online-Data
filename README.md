Revenue is concentrated in specific countries, indicating clear opportunities for geographic expansion.
Certain products generate high revenue despite lower sales volume, suggesting premium pricing strategies.
Repeat customers contribute significantly to overall revenue, highlighting the importance of retention over pure acquisition.
Customer value varies notably by region, implying that not all high-revenue markets are equally profitable on a per-customer basis.
